- This is the official repository for the paper **Sissi: Zero-shot Style-guided Image Synthesis via Semantic–style Integration**.

  - In this work, we introduce a training-free framework that reformulates style-guided generation as an in-context learning task. Guided by textual semantic prompts, our method concatenates a reference style image with a masked target image, leveraging a pretrained ReFlow-based inpainting model to seamlessly integrate semantic content with the desired style through multimodal attention fusion.
